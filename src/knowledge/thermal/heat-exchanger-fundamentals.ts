## Heat Transfer Fundamentals

### Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient (U)
**U = 1/(1/h₁ + t/k + 1/h₂ + Rf)**

Where:
- **h₁, h₂** = Individual heat transfer coefficients
- **t** = Wall thickness
- **k** = Wall thermal conductivity
- **Rf** = Fouling resistance

### Heat Transfer Rate
**Q = U × A × ΔTₗₘ**

Where:
- **Q** = Heat transfer rate (W or BTU/hr)
- **A** = Heat transfer area (m² or ft²)
- **ΔTₗₘ** = Log mean temperature difference (°C or °F)

### Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD)
**ΔTₗₘ = (ΔT₁ - ΔT₂)/ln(ΔT₁/ΔT₂)**

Where:
- **ΔT₁** = Temperature difference at one end
- **ΔT₂** = Temperature difference at other end

## Effectiveness-NTU Method

### Effectiveness (ε)
**ε = (Actual heat transfer)/(Maximum possible heat transfer)**

### Number of Transfer Units (NTU)
**NTU = (U × A)/(Cₘᵢₙ)**

Where:
- **Cₘᵢₙ** = Minimum heat capacity rate

### Capacity Ratio (Cᵣ)
**Cᵣ = Cₘᵢₙ/Cₘₐₓ**

## Design Considerations
